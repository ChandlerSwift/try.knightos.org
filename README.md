## Contributing

Want to help make [try.knightos.org](http://try.knightos.org) even better? Check out the instructions below on how to host a local copy of try.knightos.org for development.

### Hosting a local copy

If you do not have ruby installed on your system, you need to get it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). After installing ruby, you will need to install the ruby gem jekyll by running

    gem install jekyll


After installing the prerequisites, clone this repository and navigate to its root directory

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/KnightOS/try.knightos.org.git
    cd try.knightos.org


Then, you can generate the site and start the local server by using

    jekyll serve

Now, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser to see your local copy of try.knightos.org. Any changes that you make to the site source will automatically be updated when you refresh the page.
